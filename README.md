## Installation

Open a terminal window on Raspberry Pi and type:

<code> git clone https://github.com/Manuel83/craftbeerpi3</code>

This will download (clone) the software to your local Raspberry Pi.

Type <code>cd craftbeerpi</code> to navigate into the craftbeerpi folder.

Type <code>sudo ./install.sh</code>

## ATTENTION

CraftBeerPi 3.0 is a complete rewrite. Server as well as user interface. I recommend to use a second SD card for testing.
